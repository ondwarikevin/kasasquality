                        <h5 class="card-text">It is our policy to achieve customer satisfaction by ensuring documented standards are established that meet the safety, security, operational and economic objectives of the company. This is achieved through total commitment to Safety and Quality Management activities at every level within the organization. 
Fundamental to this is the operation of effective Safety and Quality Management Systems ensuring the standards we require are met whilst demonstrating continued compliance with the legislative requirements.
Quality within KASAS Ltd, is the responsibility of everyone and the implementation of our quality policy will be through our people and their motivation, education, training, competency with sufficient resources which are a management responsibility.  Continued development of our people will ensure that they are able to meet the demands of the organization.
We aim to ensure the product (our aircraft and service) meets the highest standards of safety and reliability. We will achieve this through working to defined accepted processes, using approved data, with suitably trained, capable and empowered people whilst using the Safety and Quality Management Systems to enable us to confirm our strengths and areas for attention both in a reactive and proactive manner to achieve continual improvement.
It is the policy within KASAS Ltd. to encourage a fair and just culture, with an active “no blame policy” to help the establishment of the root cause(s) of events so that robust corrective action(s) can be put in place to ensure a repetition does not occur, thereby improving the Safety/Quality of our aircraft, working practices and environment.
